// The println macro

// Prints - display information to the terminals

// Useful for debugging


    let life = 42;
    println!("hello");
    println!("{:?}", life);
    println!("{:?} {:?}", life, life);

// note that we are using a "!" character in the macro calling execution, it means that
we are calling a macro execution and not a function done by yourself
